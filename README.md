# schedules-overlapping
This program evaluates whether two appointments overlap. It only accepts whole numbers from users with military time format. For example, users should type hour 10:00 as 10 or 3:00 as 3. No floating data types should be inputed. 
WARNING: THIS IS A PRACTICE EXAMPLE FROM UCLA PIC 10A FALL 2022. THE PROGRAM WAS USED FOR PRACTICE PURPOSES. 
******Below is a visual that I created in order to understand the algorithm(s). Test appointments are 1) 10 - 12 and 11 - 13 and 2) 10 - 11 and 12 - 13.
